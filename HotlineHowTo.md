## Who Calls a Jail Support Hotline? tip: Not just protestors from jail!

- Demonstrators, activists, etc in various stages of detainment, processing or arrest
- Members of affinity groups, family, friends of people who have or they suspect have been detained or arrested
- On-site jail support volunteers calling in with information, or seeking information
- Community members who may have been detained/arrested in the ‘crossfire’ of a demonstration or action
- Activists who may be facing other forms of repression, surveillance (door knocks, etc)
- Activists who have questions about their legal rights or how the jail support hotline works


## What a Jail Support Hotline MUST Do:

1. Accept multiple inbound calls at once (sometimes many at once)
2. Route calls to an available trained volunteer as quickly as possible (less than 10 seconds ideally)
3. Provide the best call quality possible
4. Provide a voicemail for when volunteers are not available. The message must have clear instructions
5. Have a dynamic list of volunteer recipients
6. Be provided as a single, permanent number that does not change, ideally for years (you should be able to transfer numbers between phone providers)


## What a Jail Support Hotline CAN do:

- Provide an opening message to assure callers (warning: adds to delay)
- Provide an answering menu to route specific types of calls - legal, critical, etc
- Act as a call masking service for outbound calls by jail support workers


## What Type of Service Should We Use?

1. Do you need to accept collect calls?
2. Are volunteers ok with accepting calls on their personal cellphones?
3. Do you want a landline office/callcenter setup? If so, do you have a permanent location for this?


## Do We Need To Accept Collect Calls?

Here’s how you can find out:

*First, Collect a list of all potential facilities you expect demonstrators to be held at in your area:*
- Local jails
- County facilities
- Holding facilities
- Work Camps

*Then, for each facility, determine:*
    1. What is the area code for this facility?
    2. What kind of outbound calling does the facility support? 
        1. Note: this may be different when they are being processed vs in holding
    3. How many calls can they make from this facility?
    4. What are the rates for local vs out-of-area-code calls?

If in any case, actual collect calls will need to be received, your options will be limited
